### York Modular EURO-POWER - direct-mount power breakout module

First of all, you're probably wondering what a direct mount module is - easy, it's a panel-sized PCB which you attach directly to your rack. 
Maybe not so good for performance use, but for tinkering around it's perfect.

Power breakouts are great for testing, so here's one which fits directly to your rack and supplies two breakouts, plus status LEDs, inside 4HP. 
The build is simple, requiring a handful of transistors, some LEDs and the usual array of passives.  
There are three footprints for 1206 SMD fuses or 22ohm resistors, but these will be pre-soldered.
